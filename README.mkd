_props_ is a tiny module for node that is able to extract a couple of
key-value pairs from the beginning of a string. You could use it like this:

	var props = require("props");

	var str =
		'title: How to use node.js
		date: 2011-08-09T17:56:00

		Node.js is a new …';

	console.log(props(str));

This will print the following:

	[ 'Node.js is a new …';
	  title: 'How to use node.js'
	  date: '2011-08-09T17:56:00' ]
